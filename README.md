## Thoughts

* Should modules (~ drivers) output midi signals to the main app? 
* Previously known usb and ble devices should regain same config (if there are no conflicts)
* Could have an 80s style: http://www.color-hex.com/color-palette/28164
* Use easing curve from material design: https://material.io/design/motion/speed.html#easing
